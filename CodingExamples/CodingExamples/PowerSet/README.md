#  Power Set

This problem was asked by Google.

The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. Write a function that, given a set, generates its power set.

For example, given the set `{1, 2, 3}`, it should return `{{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}`.
For example, given the string `"abc"`, it should return `["", "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"]`.

You may also use a list or array to represent a set.
